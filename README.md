# BingToGoogleExtension
A Google Chrome extension that allows you to easily search google for what you just binged.

Both a Google Chrome version (that was my first attempt so it'd kinda messy), and a Microsoft Edge version (which was a 2nd attempt where I actually had to learn more about extensions since Edge doesn't really support all the things Chrome does.)
